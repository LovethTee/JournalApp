# The Preemies Journal

<p>Full stack journal app for Neonatal ICU parents to document their experience in the hospital and serve as a source of information for parents who are new to the experience.
<p>Project is inspired from my experience working in this environment and observing that families didn't really have a space to share their experiences or obtain insight from the experience of other families.</p>
